                <h2>
                    Welcome to your brief respite, adventurer.<br>
                    You and your companions have travelled far - why not play a game of dice after making camp?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The rules are simple.<br>
                    The game will go on for three rounds. During each round, you and your opponent will both roll a pair
                    of dice.<br>
                    At the end of the three rounds, the player with the most points win.<br><br>

                    Here are how points for each round are calculated:<br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If a player rolls a 1 on either of their dice, they score 0 for the round.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a player rolls a pair of the same numbers, they score the sum of both dice multiplied by
                        two.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, a player will score the sum of their two dice.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                To begin, press the "Roll Dice" button. Press the button again to advance to the next round.<br>
                To start a new game, press the "New Game" button.<br><br>

                Good luck!
